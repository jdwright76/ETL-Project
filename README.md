## Data Sets:
Restaurant and Market Health violations and Inspection - From: Kaggle
LA Health Inspection Report



### Objectives
* E: Reading csv files for inspections and violations. Scrapped Yelp for restaurant rating.

* T: Iteraite inspections and insert violations into inspection

* L: Store data in Json form to load into Mongo DB


### Summary
When we first started out it was difficult to nail down how we were going to Extract our data. Eventually we settled on the idea of grabbing 2 CSV files from Kaggle. These files are records of restraunt health inspections in LA.

Our first goal was to Transform the data into a convienient format for analysis. With these two files seperate it would be difficult for anyone to gather useful conclutions from the Datasets. We used pandas to consolidate every individual violation a restraunt had and nest it inside a column of the file with each restraunt inspected (restaurant-and-market-health-inspections.csv ).

Our goal at this point is to query yelp for the review data on each restaurant inspected. The motivation behind this is to give the Analyst more to work with.

Finally, we convert the Dataframe into a Mongo DB friendly JSON format. We simply looped the inserts into the Mongo connection.
